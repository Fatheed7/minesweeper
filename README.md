## Objective

To design an interactive version of Minesweeper with, and to demonstrate competency with, HTML, CSS & Javascript.

The was created as my second portfolio project for Code Institute's Diploma in Web Application Development.

#

## UX and UI

- ### Site Owner Goals

  The goal of the site for the owner is to:

  1. Create a fun and interactive game of Minesweeper.
  2. Allow users to customise their experience in a number of ways, including disabling animations and remembering settings set my the customer previously.
  3. Create a simple structure on a single page, to prevent errors and encourage a user to play.

#

- ### User Stories

  - #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a first time user, I want to immediately understand the purpose of the website.
    2. As a first time user, I want the option to be shown instructions on how the game works, but also to skip this if I'm already familiar with the game itself.
    3. As a first time user, I want to understand how to easily start a game, and for it to be obvious how to customise settings.

  - #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a returning user, I want the site to remember any settings set previously to prevent me needing to read the instructions again.
    2. As a returning user, I want the option to easily update any settings set previously.

- ## Fonts

- ## Favicon

#

The website [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) was used to generate the favicon image for the website. The Unicode emoji for collision, ðŸ’¥, was chosen as the icon as it is relative to the theme of the game and is recognisable due to the popularity of emojis in general.

## Features

#

## Deployment

The site was created using Visual Studio Code and GitHub, and deployed to GitHub pages for testing using the below process:

    i. Navigate to the repository on GitHub.com
    ii. Select 'Settings' from the navigation bar near the top of the page.
    iii. Select 'Pages' from the sidebar on the left of the page.
    iv. Under the 'Sources' heading, select the 'Branch' dropdown menu and select the main branch.
    v. Once selected, click the 'Save' button to the right of the dropdown menu.
    vi. Deployment should be confirmed by a message on a green background - The message should have a green tick mark followed by "Your site is published at" followed by the web address.
    vii. Confirm deployment by navigating to the displayed web address.
